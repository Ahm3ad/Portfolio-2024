                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Ahmaad Riaz, and I am currently a third-year student at Ontario Tech University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in IT Networking and IT Security. I have always been passionate about technology and driven by a desire to solve complex problems. Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, and have honed my skills with development tools like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and GitHub. My proficiency with security tools like Wireshark, LDAP, and AWS has further solidified my ability to troubleshoot and resolve technical issues. Beyond my technical skills, I am an innovative thinker, currently working on a project that leverages AI to streamline help desk operations. This project is inspired by my commitment to improving user experiences and providing efficient solutions. My experiences in both academic and professional settings have equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle real-world challenges and contribute meaningfully to any team.
